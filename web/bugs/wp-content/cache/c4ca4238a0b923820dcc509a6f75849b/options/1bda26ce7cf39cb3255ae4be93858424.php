We&#8217;ve been working long and hard to bring you this release, and I hope you enjoy using it as   much as we&#8217;e enjoyed working on it. In this release we&#8217;ve focused a tremendous amount on what   we believe to be the core of blogging &#8212; the writing interface.  Before you upgrade from an earlier version, remember that this is a major release and   thousands of lines of code have changed. Before upgrading it&#8217;s always good, <em>just in   case</em>, to make a backup of your database and WordPress files. It only takes a few minutes   and gives you a total safety net if for whatever reason things don&#8217;t work. It is also probably   a good idea to turn off your plugins, and activate them one-by-one after you&#8217;ve upgraded.   Without further ado, you can <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">download WordPress 2   right now</a>. Read on for more information about what we think you&#8217;ll love about Duke.</p>

<h3>User Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Completely Redesigned Backend</strong> &#8212; The first thing you&#8217;ll notice when you login to your   blog is the backend has been completely overhauled for both aesthetics and usability. This is   the first iteration of exciting things to come from the Shuttle team of designers that has   been volunteering their time, and look for even more aesthetic improvements in the   future.</li>
<li><strong>Faster Administration</strong> &#8212; Call it AJAX, call it DHTML, call it Larry, but we&#8217;ve paid close   attention to streamlining some of the most common tasks in managing your blog. For example if   you&#8217;re writing a post and you can add categories on the fly, much like tagging in Flickr. Also   instead of having two separate UIs for &#8220;simple&#8221; and &#8220;advanced&#8221; posting, we&#8217;ve combined them   and let you customize the layout of the page on the fly by dragging and dropping the dialogs   around. It saves where you put things so when you return it&#8217;s just like you left it. When you   delete a comment or category it will fade out without a page load.</li>
<li><strong>WYSIWYG Editing</strong> &#8212; WP dev Andy Skelton and the TinyMCE team have done a tremendous amount   of work to bring a smooth WYSIWYG editing experience to WordPress. As code purists, we are   very picky about what kind of HTML is generated, and while it&#8217;s not perfect yet (for instance   nested lists can cause trouble) for 95% of what you do post-to-post the WYSIWYG should save   you time. And if it doesn&#8217;t, you can turn it off on your profile page. One note: Safari and   older versions of Opera, both fantastic browsers, don&#8217;t yet support everything that&#8217;s needed   to do WYSIWYG, but we fully expect new versions of those browsers will continue to improve   their standards support, so it may just be a matter of time.</li>
<li><strong>Included Spam and Backup Plugins</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve included two of the most popular WordPress   plugins: Skippy&#8217;s DB backup can backup your database to a file and optionally email you a   copy; Akismet is a distributed anti-spam system which gets smarter the more people use   it.</li>
<li><strong>Resizable Editing</strong> &#8212; This is one of my personal favorite features. Ever been writing a   post and that textarea seemed a little small? Happens to me all the time, and our new rich   text editor includes a feature that lets you resize the editor on-the-fly by clicking on the   corner, just like a regular window.</li>
<li><strong>Inline Uploading</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve optimized our uploader for image, audio, and video files and   put it inline with the posting screen. You don&#8217;t have to bounce around any more when writing a   post! It also will organize your files for you as you upload them to make them easier to find   later. On the backend, each uploaded file is actually a &#8220;sub-post&#8221; so it can have individual   comments and pingbacks, its own permalink, and even a custom template based on what type of   file it is. You can click on attached files to get a menu of options, or if you&#8217;re on Firefox   you can drag and drop them into your WYSIWYG editor.</li>
<li><strong>Faster Posting</strong> &#8212; In the past if you were linking to a number of posts or pinging a lot   of update services, your posting time could appear to slow to a crawl even though everything   was instantly done on the backend. We&#8217;ve modified how this works now so posting should be   near-instantaneous, like everything else in WordPress.</li>
<li><strong>Post Preview</strong> &#8212; Another enhancement to the post screen, now when you save a post it shows   a live preview of how the post would look on your site, with the stylesheet and theme and   everything. No more publishing a post just to see if it works.</li>
<li><strong>Streamlined Importing</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve rewritten our import system from the ground up to be much   easier to use (you no longer have to edit files), put it behind authentication, and also made   it easy for new importers to be dropped into the system, much like plugins.</li>
<li><strong>User Roles</strong> &#8212; We had a ton of feedback on our old numerical user level system. No one was   exactly sure what those numbers meant! We&#8217;ve distilled the basic functions into a set of roles   &#8212; such as administrator, editor, contributor &#8212; that make it easier to understand what sort   of capabilities you&#8217;re giving your blog&#8217;s users. The new system is completely pluggable too,   so plugins can modify roles and create groups that have access to certain things.</li>
<li><strong>Header Customization</strong> &#8212; If you&#8217;re tired of the blue header in the default theme, you can   now change the colors and text of it, which we&#8217;ve included as a demo of some of the new   features available to theme authors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Developer Features</h3>
<p>On the backend we&#8217;ve done a ton of changes to clean up code, make things more consistent, and   enable a lot of new types of applications to be built on top of WordPress.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Level Options</strong> &#8212; You can now store options on a <em>per-user</em> level rather than   having them apply for the entire blog. An example of this in WP2 is with the rich text editor,   which can be turned on or off per a user&#8217;s discretion.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Abstraction</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve eliminated almost all direct SQL queries from the code and   moved them to functions and classes that make the entire program more consistent.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in Caching</strong> &#8212; WordPress now includes a completely pluggable object cache system   that cuts the number of queries most pages do in half. By default it is disk-based, but there   is already a plugin to use memcached and we expect more are on their way. We&#8217;ve only begun to   tap into this.</li>
<li><strong>Plugin Hooks Galore</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve added hooks for plugin authors wherever we could think to,   so what you&#8217;re able to do in the new system is pretty dramatic. Ne features like the WYSIWYG   and the inline uploader are completely pluggable and can be replaced entirely.</li>
<li><strong>Import Framework</strong> &#8212; The new import framework allows you to create an importer with about   a third of the code you used to need, and it can have a consistent interface with no extra   work.</li>
<li><strong>Theme Functions</strong> &#8212; Themes can now include a functions.php file that will now be loaded   like a plugin attached to the theme.</li>
<li><strong>Theme preview images</strong> &#8212; You can now include a screenshot of the theme with the download   so in the WP interface your users will see a quick preview of what it looks like.</li>
<li><strong>Hundreds and Hundreds of Bug Fixes</strong> &#8212; <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/milestone/2.0">2.0 has hundreds of tracked bugs and   enhancements</a>, many that are very subtle.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have noticed our design has changed quite a bit. We&#8217;ve also moved <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> to a newer, faster server. There were a few issues with the move which is why we&#8217;ve held off for a few days on announcing 2.0. Everything seems to be smooth sailing now.

<p>When we started, Yahoo asked &#8220;What would the perfect blog host do?&#8221; and their team has been really amazing in executing on a really kick-ass platform for serious bloggers. It took a little while, but slow cooking makes good eating. (Like WordPress 2.0!)</p>
<p>We think the hosting is good for all the baseline features you should expect &#8212; tons of storage, bandwidth, Yahoo reliability, etc. (You probably heard all about that in their <a href="http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2005/12/12/six_aparts_scores_deal_with_yahoo.html">Movable Type announcement last week</a>.)

<ul>
<li>With just a few clicks, <a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-1876573-10406412">Yahoo Web Hosting will install WordPress 2.0 complete with a few choice plugins and themes</a>. Setup one blog or two dozen in seconds.</li>
<li><strong>They will also upgrade your WordPress </strong>when a new stable release or update is available, meaning it is a zero-maintenance solution on par with <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, every Yahoo Hosting customer gets a free <a href="http://akismet.com/">Pro-Blogger Akismet license</a> ($5/mo value) and Akismet is auto-enabled on new installations, meaning that spam is less of an issue on Yahoo WordPress blogs.  (Much like their stellar email spam handling.) <a href="http://akismet.com/blog/2005/12/yodel-if-you-hate-spam/">Read more about this</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Guy Yalif from Yahoo says, &#8220;We believe that by adding WordPress&#8217; blogging application to our leading web hosting product, we are providing a top notch, scalable, and reliable solution for less than $12 per month.&#8221;</p>
<p>We think the above makes a very compelling case for WordPress users <a href="http://wordpress.org/hosting/">to check out Yahoo hosting</a>, and see what we believe is the best WordPress hosting experience on the Web. As always, if you have any feedback on Yahoo or any other host we feature, please let us know.

<p>When we started, Yahoo asked &#8220;What would the perfect blog host do?&#8221; and their team has been really amazing in executing on a really kick-ass platform for serious bloggers. It took a little while, but slow cooking makes good eating. (Like WordPress 2.0!)</p>
