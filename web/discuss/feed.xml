&lt;br /&gt;
Would you like to share your code? I was just thinking about adding an HTML
output option to the DOM creation plugin. :-)
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a little-known but serious memory leak involving innerHTML. It
happens when you mix DOM creation with innerHTML in a pattern like this:

   var e = document. [...]</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
In my case, as I said, the DOM id has the radio input value embedded in it.
&lt;br /&gt;
So, the radio value is dom1 while the DOM node is is foo_dom1_bar. So, I guess
I would need a regular expression match in the jQuery expression above? Does
jQuery support this? [...]</description>

<description>Andrea Ca'Zorzi: Working with radio elements: You'll need to identify the radio buttons, let's say they are all
called videoKillsTheRadioStar
Then you need to express the dependency between one particular radio
button and a dom node. Let's say you do that by assigning the id of
the dom node to the value of the radio button, like this:

<description>Klaus Hartl: DOM elements or HTML: Hi Frank and all,
&lt;br /&gt;
innerHtml is not a standard defined by the W3C. A browser, that claims 
to be DOM compliant therefore does not need to support innerHtml, but 
it's required to support document.create et al.
&lt;br /&gt;
In real world any major browser supports innerHtml. Maybe its becoming a 
standard. [...]</description>

<title>Working with radio elements</title>
<link>http://jquery.com/discuss/2006-March/000342/</link>
<description>jquery at vikas.mailshell.com: Working with radio elements: I have 3 radio inputs with values, say, One, Two and Three
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a DOM node (getElementById) associated with each of these values, call
them, Node_One, Node_Two and Node_Three. i.e. the DOM id has the radio input
value embedded in it.
&lt;br /&gt;
When radio input One is selected, I would like to show Node_One and hide the
other two. When radio input Two is selected, I would like to show Node_Two and
hide the other two and so on.
&lt;br /&gt;
How can I do this with jQuery?
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks

<title>version</title>

<description>Franck Marcia: version: John,
&lt;br /&gt;
I would like to ask (nicely) if you could set $().$jquery each time
jQuery evolves.
&lt;br /&gt;
For the moment, I use WinMerge to check if something new is available.
It'd be easier to look at a version number!
&lt;br /&gt;
Cheers,

Franck.

<title>roadmap for jquery and better example / vertical example of accordeon</title>
<link>http://jquery.com/discuss/2006-March/000331/</link>
<description>Armand Datema: roadmap for jquery and better example / vertical example of accordeon: Hi
&lt;br /&gt;
I have an idea for a tutoial, I would liek to comvert over some of my code
to jqury plugins. But since I learn best by example it would be great if we
had a tutorial on &amp;quot; How to convert your excisting code to jquery plugin&amp;quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
Right now I finished the beginning of a small path animation libary that I
would like to extend on and make into plgin for jquery but I am not quite
sure where to start.
&lt;br /&gt;
Also is there some sort of roadmap for jquery so we can see what in
planning/development?
&lt;br /&gt;
The accordeon sample, it flickers a lot with me on ie6, while other
accordean examples like rico or moofx are very smooth. So is this not yet
possible with jquery to get it that smooth?
&lt;br /&gt;
btw did anyone ever made a vertical ccordeon like
http://www.schwingnuke.com/dhtml/accordeonh/sample.html
&lt;br /&gt;
please dont look at the code I did this about 4 years back before all the
cool libraries and mentionings of unobtrosive javascript were nowhere to be
seen :)
&lt;br /&gt;
But i always had plans to make this into a more robust version but lack of
time so if there are any takers go ahead

<title>How to get a css value in "each"</title>
<link>http://jquery.com/discuss/2006-March/000330/</link>
<description>John Resig: How to get a css value in "each": The problem with setting CSS values via classes, etc. is that they
don't appear when you try and access them. jQuery has one helper
function for this:
