jQuery expressions are a combination of [CSS] 1-3, XPath, plus some custom code to glue it together. Essentially, the best parts from both of these query languages were taken, combined, and used to create the final jQuery expression language. If you already know [CSS] (which most web developers do) then you're going to be fine.

=== Using [CSS] and XPath Together

This is a point of confusion, for some: How can you use [CSS] and XPath together, they're so different! jQuery makes some allowances to make this happen, but we think that developers will really appreciate the advantages of each language. Here are some examples:

Hide all Paragraph elements that contain a link:
  $("p[a]").hide();

Show the first Paragraph on the page:
  $("p:eq(0)").show();

Hide all divs that are currently showing:
  $("div:visible").hide();

Get all list items that are children of an unordered list:
  $("ul/li")
  valid too: $("ul > li")

Get all Paragraphs, with a class of 'foo', that have a link in them:
  $("p.foo[a]");

All checked radio buttons:
  $("radio[@checked]")
