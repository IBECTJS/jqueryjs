jQuery has full CSS 1-3 support, along with some custom CSS-like functionality (and XPath), as part of it's [expression language BaseExpression].

For info on how CSS works feel free to read the various links:

=== Supported, but different

All attribute selectors are written like their XPath counter-parts (in that all attributes should begin with an *@* symbol).

* *E[@foo]* 	an E element with a "foo" attribute
* *E[@foo="bar"]* 	an E element whose "foo" attribute value is exactly equal to "bar"
* *E[@foo~="bar"]* 	an E element whose "foo" attribute value is a list of space-separated values, one of which is exactly equal to "bar"
* *E[@foo^="bar"]* 	an E element whose "foo" attribute value begins exactly with the string "bar"
* *E[@foo$="bar"]* 	an E element whose "foo" attribute value ends exactly with the string "bar"
* *E[@foo**="bar"] 	an E element whose "foo" attribute value contains the substring "bar"
* *E[@hreflang|="en"]* 	an E element whose "hreflang" attribute has a hyphen-separated list of values beginning (from the left) with "en"

=== Not supported

jQuery only support selectors that actually select DOM elements - everything else is ignored.

* *E:link*
* *E:visited* 	an E element being the source anchor of a hyperlink of which the target is not yet visited (:link) or already visited (:visited)
* *E:active*
* *E:hover*
* *E:focus* 	an E element during certain user actions
* *E:target* 	an E element being the target of the referring URI
* *E::first-line* 	the first formatted line of an E element
* *E::first-letter* 	the first formatted letter of an E element 
* *E::selection* 	the portion of an E element that is currently selected/highlighted by the user
* *E::before* 	generated content before an E element
* *E::after* 	generated content after an E element
