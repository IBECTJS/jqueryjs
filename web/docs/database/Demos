jQuery is very new - and new work is coming out all the time. If you have a cool demo that you'd like featured here, just drop me [an email jeresig@gmail.com] and I'll add it.

=== Applications

* [Feed Pile http://feedpile.com/], [Source Code http://feedpile.com/js/manage.js] - uses jQuery for forms and menus.

=== Demos

* [Onion Drop Shadow http://jquery.com/test/zomg.html] - this applies a drop shadow to all images on a page (based off of [Onion Drop Shadow http://ajaxian.com/archives/onion-skinned-drop-shadows-with-javascript]).

* [Cody's jQuery Examples http://codylindley.com/blogstuff/js/jquery/] - Cody wrote up a series of nice examples - it makes for a nice addition on top of the [http://jquery.com/docs/Tutorial/ Tutorial].
