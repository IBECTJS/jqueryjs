jQuery has a comprehensive set of documentation - everything from specific methods with code samples to a step-by-step [Tutorial].

=== API

Most of the methods that you might be interested in would be in the jQuery Base - but feel free to look at the other modules for the applicable information.

* [jQuery Base http://jquery.com/docs/base/] - The core functionality of jQuery - all the essentials are here, including documentation for how exactly $() works.
* [Basic Effects http://jquery.com/docs/fx/] - A break-down of how the effects work, and how to use them on your site.
* [Advanced Events http://jquery.com/docs/event/] - A number of handy helper functions are included for working with events, above and beyond what bind and unbind are capable of.

=== Plugins

These are optional plugins, developed and contributed by jQuery users.

* [AJAX Plugin http://jquery.com/docs/ajax/] - Load external data files into your site.

=== General

If you're looking for a good place to start, I'd recommend taking a look at the [Tutorial], it gives you a number of popular scenarious, and walks you through the process of using jQuery.

If you're planning on using [jQuery with Prototype PrototypeAndJQuery], make sure you read this before beginning.

If you're wondering why jQuery looks so different, you might be interested in what we call [Chainable Methods ChainableMethods].

Also, if you'd like to extend jQuery to add your own methods, you'd be interested in developing a [Plugin].
