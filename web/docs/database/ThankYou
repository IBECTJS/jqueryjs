== http://ejohn.org/images/icon.jpg Thank You!

Thank you for supporting jQuery - this means a lot to me! Every little bit is going to help me continue to bring you great code.

If you're interested in finding out more about jQuery and my other projects, please feel free to visit [http://ejohn.org my weblog], which I update frequently.

Also, if you'd like to know when I release some cool new code in the future, just [drop me an email jeresig@gmail.com] and I'll let you know, personally.
