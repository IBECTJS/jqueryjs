This is a basic tutorial, designed to help you get started using jQuery. A good place to start is by looking at common problems and the solution(s) that jQuery provides to them.

If you don't have a test page setup yet, I recommend that you create a new HTML page with the following contents, just to get started:

  <html>
  <head>
  <script type="text/javascript"
    src="http://jquery.com/src/latest/"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Your code goes here
  </script>
  </head>
  <body>
  <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>
  </body>
  </html>

=== Launching Code on Document Ready

The first thing that most Javascript programmers end up doing is adding some code to their program, similar to this:

  window.onload = function(){ ... }

Inside of which is the code that you want to run right when the page is loaded. Problematically, however, the Javascript code isn't run until all images are finished downloading (this includes banner ads, for example). The reason for using window.onload in the first place is due to the fact that the HTML 'document' isn't finished loading yet, when you first try to run your code.

To circumvent both problems, jQuery has a simple statement that you can use:
 
  $(document).ready(function(){
    // Your code here
  });

This code checks the document and waits until its ready to be manipulated - which is just what we want. So take the above snippet and stick it into the script area on your test page.

=== Making Something Happen on Click

The first thing we're going to try is having something happen whenever a link is clicked. In the onready function, try adding the following:

  $("a").click(function(){
    alert("Thanks for visiting!");
  });

Save your HTML file and reload the test page in your browser. Clicking the one link on the page should make the Alert pop-up, before leaving to go to the main jQuery page.

=== Adding a Class

Another thing that is a common task is the addition (or removal) of classes from elements, for example:

  $("a").addClass("test");

or even:

  $("a").removeClass("test");

if you were to add some style information into the header of your script, like this:

  <style>a.test{font-weight:bold}</style>

and then added the above addClass call - all your A elements would now be bold.

=== Special Effects

In the [Basic Effects http://jquery.com/docs/fx/] plugin, a couple of handy special effects are provided, to really make your web site stand out. To put this to the test, change the onclick that you added earlier to this:

  $("a").click(function(){
    $(this).hide("slow");
    return false;
  });

Now, if you click the links, it should make the link slowly dissapear. Some examples of these effects, and similar, can be found on [http://feedpile.com/ Feed Pile.com].

=== Next Steps

From here, you should probably begin looking at the rest of the [Documentation http://jquery.com/docs/] - it's very comprehensive and covers all aspects of jQuery. If you have any questions, please feel free to [drop me an email jeresig@gmail.com].
